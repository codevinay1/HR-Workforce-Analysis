ðŸ’¡ Key Insights from the Analysis
This analysis reveals several critical factors correlated with employee attrition:

1. Tenure & Onboarding

Highest Risk at Entry: Attrition is significantly highest among new employees, particularly within the first year of service. This suggests a need to review the onboarding process and early-stage employee engagement.


Mid-Career & Late-Career Peaks: Smaller attrition peaks are observed around the 5-year and 10-year  marks, indicating potential career progression or milestone-related turnover.


2. Job Role
High-Turnover Roles: Specific job roles contribute disproportionately to attrition. The top roles for employee departure are:

Laboratory Technician 

Sales Executive 


Research Scientist 


Sales Representative 


3. Demographics

Age: The 26-35 age group has the highest number of departures, indicating that mid-career professionals are the most likely to leave.



Education Field: Attrition is most common among employees with backgrounds in Life Sciences (38%) and Medical (25%).


4. Compensation
Salary Impact: There is a strong correlation between salary and attrition. The vast majority of attrition occurs in the lowest salary bracket (Upto 5k), suggesting that compensation is a critical factor in employee retention.
